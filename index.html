              <p>Two words describe our educational vision at DPSS,Madinaguda.Think Ahead.</p>
              <p>What does Think Ahead mean to us? It means:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Providing opportunities for students to lead at all grade levels.</li>
                <li>Embracing Experiential Learning in our pre-primary level.</li>
                <li>Knowing that the development of a child's character is as important as the development of their
                  cognitive skills.</li>
                <li>Dedicating our primary students to the conceptual understanding so that the child is well prepared
                  for the future.</li>
                <li>Providing a fully articulated curriculam from preschool through 6th class.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>At DPSS-, we think Ahead for the benefit of our students, every day.</p>
              <p>Any journey begins with just one step. But, without a clear picture of the destination, that setp is
                likely to be in the wrong direction. The journey to school improvement and student achievement is no
                different. Everyone involved administrators, teachers, parents and the students need to develop a
                focuses image of the goal and create a map that will lead them there together. This shared vision
                fosters success because of understanding and believing his/her role in the pursuits of helping them to
                acquire the skills they need to become productive citizens in a rapidly changing global society.</p>
              <p>I belive it "Takes a village to raise a child" and a strong connection between school,home and
                community is the foundation for high student achivement. My educational philosophy is that of a leader
                working colsely with staff,parents, and community stakeholders to ensure that all students are
                successful academically,socially and emotionally. You will find that my door is always open and I am
                here to support you in any way possible.</p>
